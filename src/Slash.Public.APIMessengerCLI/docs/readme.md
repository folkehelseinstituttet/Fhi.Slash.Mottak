# About
The client CLI provides a command-line interface for sending messages to the API. It includes options to configure encryption, manage authentication credentials, and verify message validity before submission. The CLI is designed for integration into automation workflows, making it an ideal choice for batch processing or system-to-system communication.

See your GitHub page for more information about the messaging format.

The component requires minimum .NET 8.0.
